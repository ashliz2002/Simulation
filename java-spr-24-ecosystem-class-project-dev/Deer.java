/**
 * Deer - deer can reproduce once every four turns and they must be in perfect health 
 * (note, to simplify coding, we've made deer able to asexually reproduce)
 * - deer are not affected by fire
 * - each deer has health (up to a maximum of eight points - the deer starts with eight) based on eating; 
 * each turn that the deer eats (which it does whenever it can), 
 * its health goes up by one (until the maximum); 
 * if the deer has nothing to eat, its health goes down to eat - during any given move, 
 * first the deer should eat, then the deer may move 
 * (the deer moves to whatever square adjoining it has the most food, 
 * unless the square it is on has the most food); 
 * if there is no food in its own square or an adjacent square, the deer will move randomly - 
 * deer die once their health reaches zero.
