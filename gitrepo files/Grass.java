/**
 * A simple model of grass.
 * Grass - each unit of grass can produce a new unit of grass every two turns 
 * (that is every other turn) - 
 * 
 * it reproduces in its own square or in an adjacent square 
 * (which direction it spreads, including its own square, is random)
 * 
 * - it never ages - it only dies through a fire or being eaten - 
 * 
 * you can have a maximum of ten units of vegetable material 
 * (that is, grass and trees combined) on any given square -
 * 
 * in the event of a fire, any unit of grass has a 75% chance of dying.
