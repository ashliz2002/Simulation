 * Trees - each tree can produce a new tree every five turns
 * - it reproduces in its own square or in an adjacent square
 * - it never ages - it only dies through a fire
 * - you can have a maximum of ten units of vegetable material 
 * (that is, grass and trees combined) on any given square
 * - if a tree wants to spread in a particular direction, 
 * it can eliminate the grass that is in that square if necessary 
 * to avoid violating the ten vegetable unit limitation
 * - in the event of a fire, any unit of grass has a 60% chance of dying.
